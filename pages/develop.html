                  the management of different versions of Node, and yarn for a fast, reliable, and secure dependency
                  management (install it as a global package with <strong>npm i -g yarn</strong>). Furthermore, you
                  need an GitHub account that has <a

              <p>In order to optimize the workflow and to prevent multiple contributors working on the same issue
                without
                interactions, a contributor must ask to be assigned to an issue by one of the core team members:
                it&#39;s enough
                to ask it inside the specific issue.</p>
              <h3 id="feature-requests" class="heading-4">Feature Requests</h3>
